# 📄 Payment Verification API

This API provides verification services for payment transactions made through **Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)**, **Telebirr**, **Dashen Bank**, **Bank of Abyssinia**, **CBE Birr**, and **M-Pesa** mobile payment platforms in Ethiopia.  
It allows applications to verify the authenticity and details of payment receipts by reference numbers or uploaded images.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is **not an official API**. I am **not affiliated with Ethio Telecom, Telebirr, or Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)**. This tool is built for personal and developer utility purposes only and scrapes publicly available data.

## ✅ Features

### 🚀 Universal Verification (Smart Router)

- **One endpoint to rule them all:** Verifies transactions from multiple providers (CBE, Telebirr, Dashen, Bank of Abyssinia, CBE Birr) using a single, intelligent endpoint (`POST /verify`). _Note: M-Pesa is currently supported via its dedicated endpoint only._
- Automatically detects the provider based on the format of the provided `reference` number and accompanying JSON payload.
- Strictly validates payloads and intelligently delegates to the correct backend service.

### 🔷 CBE Payment Verification

- Verifies CBE bank transfers using reference number and account suffix
- Extracts key payment details:
  - Payer name and account
  - Receiver name and account
  - Transaction amount
  - Payment date and time
  - Reference number
  - Payment description/reason

### 🔶 Telebirr Payment Verification

- Verifies Telebirr mobile money transfers using a reference number
- Extracts key transaction details:
  - Payer name and Telebirr number
  - Credited party name and account
  - Bank name (if the transaction was made to another bank)
  - Transaction status
  - Receipt number
  - Payment date
  - Settled amount
  - Service fees and VAT
  - Total paid amount

### 🔷 Dashen Bank Payment Verification

- Verifies Dashen bank transfers using reference number
- Extracts comprehensive transaction details:
  - Sender name and account number
  - Transaction channel and service type
  - Narrative/description
  - Receiver name and phone number
  - Institution name
  - Transaction and transfer references
  - Transaction date and amount
  - Service charges, taxes, and fees breakdown
  - Total amount

### 🔶 Bank of Abyssinia Payment Verification

- Verifies Bank of Abyssinia transfers using reference number and 5-digit suffix
- Extracts key transaction details:
  - Transaction reference and details
  - Account information
  - Payment amounts and dates
  - Verification status

### 🔷 M-Pesa Payment Verification

- Verifies M-Pesa mobile money transfers using receipt reference
- Extracts transaction details from the generated receipt PDFs

### 🔷 CBE Birr Payment Verification

- Verifies CBE Birr mobile money transfers using receipt number and phone number
- Extracts transaction details:
  - Receipt and transaction information
  - Payer and receiver details
  - Transaction amounts and fees
  - Payment status and timestamps
  - Ethiopian phone number validation (251 format)

### 🔷 Image-based Payment Verification

- Verifies payments by analyzing uploaded receipt images
- Uses **Mistral AI** to detect receipt type and extract transaction details
- Supports both **CBE** and **Telebirr** receipt screenshots

## 🌐 Hosting Limitations for `verify-telebirr` and `verify-mpesa`

Due to **regional restrictions** by the Telebirr system and Safaricom M-Pesa, hosting these endpoints outside of Ethiopia/Kenya (e.g., on a foreign VPS like Hetzner or AWS) may result in failed receipt verification. Specifically:

- Telebirr’s receipt pages (`https://transactioninfo.ethiotelecom.et/receipt/[REFERENCE]`) often **block or timeout** requests made from foreign IP addresses.
- Safaricom's M-Pesa API (`https://m-pesabusiness.safaricom.et/api/receipt/getReceipt`) strictly blocks connections from foreign data centers, resulting in `504 Gateway Timeout` or `500 Internal Server Errors`.

### ❌ Affected:

- VPS or cloud servers located outside Ethiopia/Kenya

### ✅ Works Best On:

- Ethiopian-hosted servers (e.g., Ethio Telecom web hosting, TeleCloud VPS)
- Developers self-hosting the code on infrastructure based in Ethiopia

#### 🛠 Proxy Support:

This project supports secondary fallback verification relays hosted inside Ethiopia. When the primary `verify-telebirr` or `verify-mpesa` fetch fails on your foreign VPS, the server can **fallback to our proxy** to complete the verification.
A standalone `mpesa.php` file is included in the `.github` / repository root which can be easily hosted on any cheap generic cPanel host inside Ethiopia to act as your own private proxy.
Set `MPESA_PROXY_KEY` in your `.env` to the same key you configured in `mpesa.php`.

For best results and full control, clone the repository and **self-host the main Node.js application from inside Ethiopia**.

---

### 🔁 Skip Primary Verifier (For VPS Users)

If you know your environment cannot access the primary endpoint, set the following in your `.env`:

```env
SKIP_PRIMARY_VERIFICATION=true
```

This will skip the primary Telebirr receipt fetch entirely and go straight to the fallback proxy — only for your local use case. Other users can still benefit from both layers.

## 📝 Logging

- Uses [`winston`](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for structured logging.
- Log files are stored under the `logs/` directory:
  - `logs/error.log` – error-level logs
  - `logs/combined.log` – all logs including debug/info
- `debug` logs are **only visible in development** mode (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`).

To override log level manually:

```env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- Axios – HTTP requests
- Cheerio – HTML parsing
- Puppeteer – headless browser automation (used for CBE scraping)
- Winston – structured logging
- Prisma + PostgreSQL (persistent storage)
- Mistral AI – OCR for image-based verification

---

## 🛠 Prisma Integration

- `apiKey` model stores API key, usage count, owner, timestamps.
- `usageLog` model stores every request metadata:
  - endpoint, method, status code, duration, IP, API key ID

Stats are used for `/admin/stats` endpoint and dashboard monitoring.
